Hello! I'm Michael, a biomedical research scientist who completed a Master's of Science in Physiology and Pharmacology, specializing in fibrotic disease and melanoma metastasis. 
Afterwards, I gained experience in the Pharmaceutical industry in Phase 4 clinical trial management. 
I then decided to pursue my passion and development, independently learning coding with python and machine learning libraries such as Tensorflow and Keras for the purpose of analyzing clinical data to find new trends and insights. 
Later, I joined BenchSci as a Scientific Analyst to assist in reforming their QA workflow to improve oversight and reporting. 
Now, I am looking to combine all my skills to use AI and data analytics in a clinical setting.
